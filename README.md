# pay-card
This is a card payment form which inputs user card details on the card while inputting their details
It was done with html,css and javascript
The functionality behind it was making card numbers to be only numbers and if otherwise,an error border should 
show up to show the user that there is an invalid input.
The card logo is supposed to show either visa, master or american express depending on the card number being inputed.

# My Difficulty
I had a bit of problem while implementing the functionality with javascript because this was a first project that i had to use javascript a lot.
Making functions for the card logo to change and also for the input focus.
